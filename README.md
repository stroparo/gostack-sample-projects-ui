# Projects UI GoStack 12 sample

This project implements a UI with ReactJS to exhibit projects information provided by [the projects sample API](https://github.com/stroparo/gostack-sample-projects-api).

This was made by following ReactJS classes in level 1 of the GoStack 12th edition by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/), a major software development bootcamp in Brazil.

## Requirements

* Node v12.x.x
* Yarn 1.x.x

## Development Environment Setup

Clone this repository, enter its directory and execute this command in the shell/terminal:

```bash
